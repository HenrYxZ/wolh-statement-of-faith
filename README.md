## Welcome!

We are students of the Word of Life Bible Institute Hungary. This webpage is to present our statement of Christian faith. Everything we have included here comes solely from our understanding of the Bible which is Gods own word to humans.  

**The Gospel is the good news of Jesus Christ and how he died for our sin and rose from the dead. Because he paid the penalty for our sin, we can be justified and have eternal life with God. All we need to do to receive this salvation is to believe and to trust in Jesus Christ. This means knowledge of who Christ is, acceptance of his person and work, and trusting in Christ alone to save.**

### Bibliology

We believe that  
- The Scriptures are the Word of God and that human writers were inspired by the Holy Spirit to write every single word (2 Tim 3:16, 2 Pe 1:20-21).
- The Scriptures are powerful to change the human hard and is the revelation from God to the men. 
- The original manuscript doesn’t have errors, everything that was written on it is the final authority of God, everything was written as it was meant and everything on it is true and profitable for the readers. 
- The Holy Spirit is the one that allows believers to understand the Scriptures (Jn 16:12-15, 1 Cor 2:9-3:2) 
- We can get to know God by his Word as he presents his attributes in the Scriptures, but we cannot fully understand or know him as he is eternal and infinite beyond our capacity. 
- The Scriptures are sufficient, there is no need for more revelation for the believers. 

### Trinity 

We believe that 
- According to the Scripture, God is one (Deut 6:4; James 2:19) but at the same time, he exists in three different persons (Isaiah 48:16; John 1:1) 
- The persons: God the Father (1Peter 1:2), God the Son (Jesus) (John 10:30), and God the Holy Spirit (1Corinthians 2:10) 
- They are in complete unity (Matthew 3:16-17) 
- God is  
  - Eternal (no beginning, no end) 
  - Perfect 
  - Just 
  - Holy 
  - Love 
  - Unchangeable 
  - Able to do anything 
  - Everywhere 
  - All knowing 
  - Sovereign 
  - Unity

### Paterology

We believe that
- The Father is God, the first person of the trinity 
- The Father is the most high
- He has names that describe his attributes: 
  - Elohim (the strong, leader, the sovereign God of creation) 
  - Jahve (who was, is, and will be) 
  - Adonai (Lords, masters, owners) 
  - God (Theos)  
  - Lord (Kurios) (John 4:11) 
  - Master (Despota) (owner) (2Peter 2:1) 
  - Father (James 1:17) 
- The Father of Jesus and us 
- The Creator and Ruler of all 

### Christology 

We believe that 
- Jesus Christ is perfect in deity and perfect in humanity 
- He is eternal, omnipotent, sinless Son of God, the second person of the Trinity 
- Jesus Christ is our lord and savior, who was born from virgin, crucified by the Romans and raised (bodily) from the dead on the third day 
- Christ ascended to Heaven, and will return to judge the nations, to establish his kingdom, and to rule from David’s throne 
- Jesus is our high priest, who presented himself as the God-pleasing, perfect, once-and-for-all sacrifice. He is the mediator before God the Father in our (the believers) behalf 

### Pneumatology 

We believe that 
- the Holy Spirit is divine, the third person of the Trinity 
- Eternal, omnipotent, omnipresent, omniscience 
- Every believer is the temple of the Holy Spirit, who seals the Christians for salvation 
- The Holy Spirit protects, guides, teaches, confronts, convince, sanctify us and gives strength and gifts for Christian living

### Angelology

We believe that
- Angels are spiritual beings created by God
- Angels can be seen in human form and interact with humans 
- Angels are to worship and serve God, to be his messengers and to carry out God’s judgement 
- Angels have free will
- Angels are organized into ranks 
- Demons (unclean spirits) are fallen angels  
- Demons are actively opposing God using spiritual power 
- Satan was a cherub who lead 1/3 of the angels in rebellion against God 
- Satan has reign on the Earth currently to have power over and to deceive non-believers 
- Satan will have control over the world during the period of tribulation 
- God has ultimate authority over Satan and all the demons and protects believers from being possessed by demons 
- Demons can possess unbelievers 

### Christian anthropology, Hamartiology 

We believe that 
- God created the heavens and the earth (Gen 1:1) 
- God created mankind good, men and women in his own image for a relationship with him  
- After the rebellion of Adam and Eve mankind got separated from God, sin and death entered the world 
- Sin is everything what contradicts God’s original, perfect design (against God) 
- All humans are sinful, completely fallen and lost so rightly deserve God’s judgement and eternal condemnation.

### Soteriology 

We believe that 
- God is gracious and merciful, and he doesn’t gain pleasure in condemning sinners
- The salvation of humans cannot be deserved. It’s God’s sovereign choice to show mercy to sinners.  
- God freely and voluntarily made a way (only through Jesus Christ) to restore the broken relationship.   
- God calls and justifies sinners by grace through faith in Jesus Christ, who died to pay the penalty of sin 
- Jesus Christ was bodily raised from the dead
- Because of the perfect, once-for-all substitutionary atonement of Christ God declares all believers righteous, forgives all their sin, and guaranties eternal life and relationship with himself 
- Once somebody believes the Gospel the Holy Spirit gets dwelling in him/her, and starts to sanctify the person 
- Salvation is God’s gift, regardless to our deeds, so we cannot do anything to lose it. God is faithful, so he will not forsake or condemn his children 

### Ecclesiology

We believe that 
- The Church began on the day of Pentecost as recorded in Acts 2 but before that, it was a mystery.
- The Church is the body of Christ with Christ himself at the head.
- The Church is distinct from the nation of Israel. 
- The Jews are still God’s chosen people and the Old Testament covenants still exclusively apply to them. (Abrahamic, Sinai, Palestinian, Davidic, New).
- The function of the church is to be a place of worship, to proclaim the gospel, to minister to the world, and to discipline its members against sin.
- The church must strive to achieve unity above all else. 
- God gave the church authority to lead congregations in ordinances, namely Baptism and the Lords supper. These being physical symbols of spiritual, inward changes. 
- The Holy Spirit is active in the church and gives it power, guidance, comfort, and spiritual gifts.  
- The Holy Spirit gives all believers spiritual gifts.
- Churches must be led by one or two pastors in addition to a group of elders and decans. They must be people who are above reproach, are servant leaders, and have the spiritual gift of leadership. They responsible for teaching, leading, praying, and guarding true doctrine.

### Escathology 

We believe that
- there are 5 points of Escathology in which every Christian should agree. These are: 
  - death and a disembodied state, 
  - the return of Christ, 
  - that there will be physical resurrection, 
  - there will be a judgment,
  - a final eternal state.
- After death believer’s souls go to the presence of the Lord and their bodies wait until the resurrection (Luke 23:43).
- At the resurrection the body of dead believers will come to life in a glorified body just as Christ was raised from the dead. 
- We believe that there will be a rapture of the church before the 7-year tribulation period. The living Christians will meet the Lord in the clouds and the dead Christians will be raised (1 Thessalonians 4:13-18). This tribulation is the 70th week of Daniel 9 and the antichrist will establish a covenant with Israel at the beginning of the tribulation and in the middle of the 7 years he will defile the temple and stop the sacrifices. At the end of this, the millennial kingdom of Christ will be established (Rev 20:2-7). This will be the fulfillment of the Davidic Covenant which says that there will be a righteous king that would rule forever in Israel and there will be believers from all dispensations in there. 
- The millennial kingdom will be righteous and peaceful, and it will be literally for 1000 years (Isaiah 11:3-7).
- At the end of the millennium Satan will be released and will be thrown to the Lake of Fire for forever and there will be a final judgement.
- After this there will be new heaven and new earth and there will be an eternal state without sin (Re. 21-22).
